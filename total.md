### Methods:
- `POST`: Converts uploaded documents to raw text.
### Inputs:
- Documents (multipart/form-data).
### Outputs:
- Raw text (JSON).
### Error Handling:
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for failed conversions.
### Notes:
- This microservice is responsible for converting documents of various formats to raw text.

## 3. Natural Language to Vector Microservice
### Endpoint:
- `/text-to-vector`
### Methods:
- `POST`: Converts raw text or user queries to vectors.
### Inputs:
- Raw text or user queries (JSON).
### Outputs:
- Vectors (JSON).
### Error Handling:
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for failed conversions.
### Notes:
- This microservice is responsible for converting raw text and user queries to vectors efficiently.

## 4. Retriever Microservice
### Endpoint:
- `/retrieve`
### Methods:
- `POST`: Retrieves relevant documents based on input vectors.
### Inputs:
- Vectors (JSON).
### Outputs:
- Relevant documents (JSON).
### Error Handling:
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for failed retrievals.
### Notes:
- This microservice interacts with the Vector Database to retrieve relevant documents efficiently.

## 5. Ranker Microservice
### Endpoint:
- `/rank`
### Methods:
- `POST`: Ranks the retrieved documents based on relevance.
### Inputs:
- Retrieved documents (JSON).
### Outputs:
- Ranked documents (JSON).

## 6. Response Generation (ResGen) Microservice
### Endpoint:
- `/generate-response`
### Methods:
- `POST`: Generates coherent and accurate responses based on ranked documents and user queries.
### Inputs:
- Ranked documents and potentially user's natural language query (JSON).
### Outputs:
- Generated response (JSON).
### Error Handling:
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for failed generations.
### Notes:
- This microservice is responsible for generating coherent and accurate responses based on ranked documents and user queries.

## 7. Vector Database
### Endpoint:
- `/vector-db`
### Methods:
- `GET`: Retrieves vectors/documents based on similarity search.
- `POST`: Stores vectors.
- `DELETE`: Removes vectors.
### Inputs:
- Vectors for storage and similarity search queries (JSON).
### Outputs:
- Relevant vectors/documents based on similarity search (JSON).
### Error Handling:
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for failed operations.
### Notes:
- This microservice is responsible for storing vectors efficiently and enabling fast similarity search.

## General Considerations
- **Security:** Secure all endpoints, possibly using API keys or OAuth tokens to ensure only authorized access.
- **Versioning:** Consider versioning your API from the start, e.g., `/v1/document-to-text`.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to protect your services from abuse.
- **CORS:** Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly if your services are to be accessed from different domains.
